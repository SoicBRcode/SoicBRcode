# About me

I'm just a programmer that codes for fun.

What I currently do with my coding skills:
- gamedev
- esolangs
- maintain my Minecraft server


List of non-esoteric programming languages that I know (approximately from most fluent to least fluent):
- C#
- GDScript
- C
- Java
- Nim
- Lua
- Python
- BatchScript
- C++ (I don't use it anymore, never got too far with it, could relearn it if I wanted)

# My Minecraft server

If you are looking for an anarchy server to play, check out scfanarchy.ggs.gg ! Cool things about the server:
- no gameplay rules (though some game-breaking hacks and exploits don't work)
- has /softtpa . It's an unique command that is similar to /tpa but is way more balanced
- duping is allowed
- no lag
- oldest active anarchy server in Brazil
- is on offline mode
- has discord integration
- and more!
